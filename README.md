## I am a Computer Science Major with a Data Science Background

I have attended New College Of Florida for :star2:3 years:star2:. I have just one year left to complete my 4 year degree in Computer Science and plan to major in CS and minor in mathmatics with a desire to focus on Machine Learning.

When I encounter a problem I try to throw code at it. Forgot what my work schdule is? Made a bot to update my calendar and throw alarms in time for me to get ready. Forget to respond to Discord Messages? Made a program that sticks on top where new messages can only be removed if I send a message back. 

I am a strong advocate for accesibility and ease of use. Forgetting things or having a tough time where others don't is not a crime, and if computers can fill in that gap then it just means we're stronger for it :grinning:
