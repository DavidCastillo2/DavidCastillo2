## I am a Computer Science Major with a Data Science Background

I have attended New College Of Florida for :star2:3 years:star2:. I have just one year left to complete my 4-year degree in Computer Science and plan to major in CS and minor in mathematics with a desire to focus on Machine Learning.

When I encounter a problem I try to throw code at it. Forgot what my work schedule is? Made a bot to update my calendar and throw alarms in time for me to get ready. Forget to respond to Discord Messages? Made a program that sticks them to my screen where new messages can only be removed if I send a message back.

I am a strong advocate for accessibility and ease of use. Forgetting things or having a tough time isn't a crime, and if computers can help fill in that gap then it just means we're stronger for it :grinning:
